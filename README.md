### What I learned

I learnt that the freedom of CSS is it's biggest strength.

```css
  main{
    border-radius: 15px;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding-top: 3mm;
    padding-left: 3mm;
    padding-bottom: 3mm;
    padding-right: 3mm;
    width: 15%;
    margin-left: 40%;
    margin-top: 5%;
    margin-right: 40%;
    margin-bottom: 5%;
    font-family: Outfit;
  }
```
### Continued development
I definately need more real world projects to keep on experimenting with in order to improve my skills.
